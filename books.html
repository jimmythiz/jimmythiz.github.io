                    <h3>Book One of Two of the Carl Saga</h3>
                    <h4>Roaming through New York City at three a.m., twenty-three-year-old April May stumbles across a giant sculpture. Delighted by its appearance and craftsmanship—like a ten-foot-tall Transformer wearing a suit of samurai armor—April and her best friend, Andy, make a video with it, which Andy uploads to YouTube. The next day, April wakes up to a viral video and a new life. News quickly spreads that there are Carls in dozens of cities around the world—from Beijing to Buenos Aires—and April, as their first documentarian, finds herself at the center of an intense international media spotlight.</h4>

                        <h4>In April’s absence, her friends are trying to find their footing in a post-Carl world. Andy has picked up April’s mantle of fame, speaking at conferences and online; Maya, ravaged by grief, begins to follow a string of mysteries that she is convinced will lead her to April; and Miranda is contemplating defying her friends’ advice and pursuing a new scientific operation…one that might have repercussions beyond anyone’s comprehension. Just as it is starting to seem like the gang may never learn the real story behind the events that changed their lives forever, a series of clues arrive – mysterious books that seem to predict the future and control the actions of their readers – all of which seems to suggest that April could be very much alive.</h4>

This is a book that thinks deeply and wisely about fame, wealth, the internet, and the future of humanity, but also, and I’m not sure how Hank pulled this off, it’s fun as hell. <br>
