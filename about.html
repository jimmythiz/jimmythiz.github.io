            <h2>About Hank</h2>
            <h3>Hank Green has been making things on the internet since the early 90s.</h3>
            <h4>Since starting a video blog with his brother in 2007, Hank has launched, built, and sustained a number of projects. He’s a science communicator, video creator, and entrepreneur. In 2007, he and his brother started a video blog called Vlogbrothers that continues to this day. That year, they also created The Project for Awesome, a charity project that has raised over $10M for charities to date. In 2008, Hank launched DFTBA.com with his friend Alan Lastufka, that company now helps dozens of creators create and sell products including Nathan Zed, Kurzgesagt, and The McElroy Brothers. In 2010, Hank created VidCon, which has become the world’s largest gathering that celebrates the community, craft, and industry of online video.

            <p><br> VidCon was acquired by Viacom in 2018. In 2012 Hank and John launched SciShow and Crash Course and created their educational media company, Complexly, which produces content that is used in nearly every high school in America and has produced videos that have been viewed more than two billion times.</p></h4>

            In 2013, Hank launched Subbable, a subscription-based crowdfunding platform that was acquired by Patreon in 2015. Hank and his brother also entered the world of podcasting in 2015 with “Dear Hank and John” a dubious advice podcast. He has since added “Delete This” a podcast where his wife critiques his twitter feed, and “SciShow: Tangents” a science-focused, humorous game show to his list of podcasts. Complexly continues to launch and grow YouTube channels including “Journey to the Microcosmos,” “Eons,” “Healthcare Triage,” “Origin of Everything,” “SciShow Kids,” and more. Hank lives in Montana with his wife and son.
